    1 define a grade for each cloze by a number (optional). This used for calculation of question grading.<br />
    :SHORTANSWER: define the type of cloze sub-question. Definition is bounded by \':\'. <br />
    ~ is a seperator between answer options<br />

The student responds by clicking on words to select them, and clicking a second time to unselect them.</p>
<p>It provides an introduction field where words will not be selectable at runtime and a questiontext field. In the question text any words with braces around them will be considered correct. All words can be clicked-on to select.</p>
